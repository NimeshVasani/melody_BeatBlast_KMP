## How KMP Works:

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) empowers developers to build cross-platform applications using a single codebase. With KMP, developers can write shared Kotlin code that compiles into native code for multiple platforms, eliminating the need to maintain separate codebases for Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop.

Here's how KMP works in MelodyBeatBlast:

1. **Shared Kotlin Code**: The core logic of MelodyBeatBlast, including networking, business logic, and data manipulation, is written in Kotlin and shared across all platforms.
   
2. **Platform-Specific Implementations**: While the majority of the code is shared, platform-specific implementations are provided to interact with platform-specific APIs and UI components.
   
3. **Gradle Multiplatform Plugin**: The Gradle Multiplatform Plugin facilitates the compilation of Kotlin code into platform-specific binaries, ensuring optimal performance and native integration on each platform.

## Get Started:

To get started with MelodyBeatBlast, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the MelodyBeatBlast repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Set Up Spotify API Credentials**: Obtain your Spotify Web API credentials and configure them in the app to enable Spotify integration.

3. **Build and Run**: Use your preferred IDE or build tool to compile and run MelodyBeatBlast on your desired platform.
